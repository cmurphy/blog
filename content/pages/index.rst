About Me
========

I'm Colleen Murphy, a software engineer at SUSE where I currently work on
`Rancher <https://rancher.com/>`_ with a focus on platform security.
I've been known in the open source world for my involvement in OpenStack as a
team lead, and for my work on Puppet Forge modules. I'm passionate about Linux,
open source, collaboration, and fixing things.
